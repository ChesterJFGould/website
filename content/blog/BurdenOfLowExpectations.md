This semester I set myself a few goals, one of which being that I will write a single blog post.
However, I think now that this was a mistake.
If writing a blog post was truly difficult and time consuming, then maybe it would have been appropriate.
But as it stands, it takes me at most an hour to write one and publish it.
This means that in my head I know that it's a small thing, a simple thing, and so I procrastinate.

I think the problem here is the mismatch between the simplicity of writing a blog post and the importance it is given by making it a semester goal.
My other two goals are quite large, both being writing semi-complicated pieces of software.
Therefore I am officially upgrading my blog writing goal to one post a day, leaving myself no room for procrastination.
