# Extensionally
+ Pleasant to look at, it is not currently
+ Esoteric, obvious things should be easy to find, but I like websites that you can explore and find hidden gems in
+ A record of my thoughts, not academic writing that I assert to be true. This would set too high a bar for poasts.
+ A record of things I like, I enjoy websites which link to other material the author enjoys

# Intensionally
+ Easy to publish to. Pushing to main in my git repo should automatically trigger a pull and build on my server. There should also be an easy way to publish from my phone (that this isn't easy has hindered some of my poasts being published in the past few days).
+ Described in one place. I like the idea of taking a leaf from choreographic programming and writing a Haskell library which lets you describe a website in Haskell and then serves it.
+ Resource efficient, shouldn't be bloated with js frameworks just to show something easily described as a static site. This doesn't mean that I couldn't have pages which are resource intensive, there just needs to be a good reason for it.
+ Easy to develop. Though I want to ditch Hugo, live reloading is incredibly nice to have, somehow this needs to be possible with my Haskell framework (even if it is just monitoring files for changes, then killing the server, re-compiling it, and running it again).
