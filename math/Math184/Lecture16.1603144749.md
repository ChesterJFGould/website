## Marginal Revenue
We can express marginal revenue in the following way

|dR over dp = d over dp (pq)|
|= q(1 + p over q dq over dp )|

|dR over dp > 0| if and only if |q(1 + p over q dq over dp) > 0|

From this we can prove that |dR over dp > 0| if and only if |p over q dq over dp
< -1|.
Recall that |dq over dp| is negative as if we increase the price, demand will
fall.
This means that when elasticity is equal to |-1| we will get the maximal
revenue, as |dR over dp = 0|.

## Example 1
Suppose the demand curve for a product is given by |q = 500 - 10p|

a) Compute the price elasticity of this demand function.

We know elasticity is |p over q dq over dp|
This gives us

|E n( p n) = p over q dq over dp|
|= p over {500 - 10p} cdot d over dp (500 - 10p)|
|= -10p over {500 - 10p}|
|= p over {p - 50}|

b) What is the price elasticity of demand when the price is 30$?

|E(30) = 30 over {30 - 50}|
|= - 3 over 2|

c) What's the percent change in the demand if the price is 30$ and increases
by 4.5%.

We know |{DELTA q / q} over {DELTA p / p} approx E(p)|

At |p = 30| we get

|{DELTA q} over q approx (0.045) cdot E(30)|
|approx -0.0675|

This means that the demand will be decreased by 6.75%.

## Example 2
Benson just opened a business selling calculators.
The demand function for calculators can be give by |q = 400 - 2p sup 2|.
Find the price which will maximize revenue.

|E n( p n) = p over q cdot dq over dp|
|= p over {400 - 2p sup 2} cdot d over dp (400 - 2p sup 2 )|
|= p over {400 - 2p sup 2} cdot -4p|
|= {2p sup 2} over {p sup 2 - 200}|

We need to find |p| such that |E(p) = -1|

|{2p sup 2} over {p sup 2 - 200}|
|2p sup 2 = -p sup 2 + 200}|
|3p sup 2 = 200|
|p approx 8.161|

So Benson should sell his calculators for about 8 dollars and 16 cents.
