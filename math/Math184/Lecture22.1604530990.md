## Maximum and Minimum
Let |f| be defined on an interval |I| containing a number |c|.

(i) |f(x)| has a maximum (also called the absolute or global maximum) value on I if |f(c) >= f(x)| for all x in |I|.
In this case |f(c)| is called the maximum value of |f(x)| on |I|.

(ii) |f(x)| has a minimum (also called the absolute or global minimum) value on I if |f(c) <= f(x)| for all x in |I|.
In this case |f(c)| is called the minimum value of |f(x)| on |I|.

Not all functions will have a maximum or a minimum on some interval |I| if the interval contains a point that would be the maximum or minium but is not defined.

## Extreme Value Theorem
A function that is continuous on [a, b] has both a maximum and a minium on this interval.

## Interior Points
A number |c| is called an interior point of [a, b] if |a < c < b|

## Local Maximum and Minimum
Let |f| be defined on [a, b] and let |c| be an interior point.
If there is an open interval containing |c| such that |f(c)| is the maximum or minimum value of |f(x)| on the open interval, then |f(c)| is called a local (or relative) maximum or minimum value.
This is to say that if you can find **any** open interval such that |f(c)| is the maximum or minimum value on that interval, |f(c)| is considered a local maximum or minimum.
