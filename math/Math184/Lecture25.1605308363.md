## Example 1
Let |f(x) = {x sup 3 + 3} over {x - 1}|.
Determine the local extrema of |f(x)|.

|f prime (x) = {x sup 2 - 2x - 3} over {(x - 1) sup 2}|

|x sup 2 - 2x - 3 = 0|
|x = -1,3|

Therefore |x = -1, 3| are critical points.
As |x = 1| is not in the domain of |f| there are not singular points.

|f prime (x)| changes from positive to negative at |x = -1| and from negative
to positive at |x = 3|.
Therefore these two points are local maxima and minima respectively.

## Example 2
Find the intervals on which the function
|f(x) = 3x sup 4 - 4x sup 3 - 12 x sup 2 + 5| is increasing or decreasing.

|f prime (x) = 12 x sup 3 - 12 x sup 2 - 24 x|
|= 12x(x sup 2 - x - 2)|
|= 12x(x + 1)(x - 2)|

Therefore |f prime| is zero at |x = -1, 0, 2| and these are the three critical
points.
By testing the sign of |f prime| on the intervals between these points we can
see that |f| is increasing on |(-1, 0)| and |(2, inf )| and decreasing on
|(- inf , -1)| and |(0, 2)|.

## Concavity
Let |f| be differentiable on an interval |I|.

+ The graph of |f| is concave up (CU) on |I| if |f prime| is increasing on |I|
+ the graph of |f| is concave down (CD) on |I| if |f prime| is decreasing on |I|

These correspond to the sign of the second derivative of |f|.

+ |f prime prime > 0 -> | CU
+ |f prime prime < 0 ->| CD

## Example 3
Identify the intervals on which the graph of
|f(x) = x sup 3 + 6 x sup 2 + 9x + 12| is CU or CD.

|f prime = 3x sup 2 + 12 x + 9|
|f prime prime = 6x + 12|

|f prime prime = 0|
|x = -2|

Therefore |f| is CD on |(- inf , -2)| and CU on |(-2, inf )|.
