# Known Good Software
---

Good software is not only a pleasure to use, but is well written.
Unfortunately most software is rarely a pleasure to use, let alone well written.

## Terminal Emulators

This class of software shouldn't still be so important by now, finding a better solution for creating interfaces to things is a top priority.

## Web Browsers

There are no known web browsers which even approach being good.
Use something open source, a free browser might be a contradiction in terms.

## Text Editors

Text is the most extensible data format at the moment.
Being able to edit it will be of vital importance while this is true.

## Programming Languages

To what degree we should ignore the underlying execution of the code and in what way is unclear.
Therefore languages such as Haskell cannot be considered good software at the present time.

+ Go
