An interesting tenet of our current democratic system is the insistence that the best way achieve the change you want to see in world is to kindly ask for it.
This is exactly what the proposition of a representative democracy is, you get a representative (whom you may or may not have voted for) and then you will take your ideas for change to them and they will talk it over with the rest of the representatives.
Now in our discourse we will ignore the reality of the situation, which is that this is not at all how it works.
In reality you take your ideas to a lobbyist along with a big pile of cash, and then *they* take the representative out to dinner and (hopefully) sound convincing enough for the representative to take the idea seriously (if they don't then you better hope it was a nice dinner).
I won't make any argument against this as I think it speaks for itself, and I would assume the majority of people would be be in favour of eliminating lobbying if it came down to a vote (the fact that it doesn't should make you think about where the power truly lies).
No today we will be discussing why representative democracy has come to the end of its road, and what will be replacing it.

The advent of modern day cryptography in conjuction with the internet has been hilarious.
This is in fact probably the best example where the system of "kindly asking for change" has smacked up against a wall.
You see with the invention of end-to-end encryption there in fact very little reason to still "protect" freedom of speech in law.
Instead of pinky promising to never ever censor speech (unless it might be dangerous (or even *gasp* offensive))
