# The Unreasonable Power of Shell Scripting
---
One of the many hilarities of modern day computing is that one of our oldest and most poorly designed languages (by todays standards) is in fact one of our most powerful languages.
This language (or family of languages) exhibits poor syntax, an eclectic smattering of operators, no support for data structures besides the string; number; and completely obscure array, and incredibly poor ability for abstraction, and yet it is the only language which has completely seamless concurrency and parallelism, and a successful and thriving component architecture.
I am of course talking about Bash, and more generally the family of POSIX shell scripting languages.
